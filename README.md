## Environment Setup

Before you begin, update your package list and upgrade your system:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

Install the necessary packages for your terminal and development environment:

```bash
sudo apt install neovim git tmux zsh
```

Change your default shell to Zsh:

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Install Oh My Zsh for managing your Zsh configuration:

```bash
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

Install Nerd Fonts for additional glyphs:

```bash
# Replace <nerd-fonts-download-url> and <nerd-fonts-zip-file> with actual values
wget <nerd-fonts-download-url>
unzip <nerd-fonts-zip-file>
cp <nerd-fonts-files> /usr/share/fonts/ and /usr/local/share/fonts/
```

Configure your shell prompt with Starship:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(starship init zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Set up Message of the Day (MOTD) using ASCII art:

```bash
# Generate ASCII art at the provided TAAG link and add it to your MOTD file
```

Configure SSH with no root passwords and a custom port:

```bash
# Edit your sshd_config file to include:
PermitRootLogin no
Port 8997
```

Install additional utilities:

```bash
sudo apt install log2ram nala
```

## Webserver Setup

Install and configure Nginx:

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

## API Server Setup

Install Node.js and npm, and the necessary Node packages:

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs npm
npm install ntp express
```

## OS Setup

Your Raspberry Pi with Bullseye OS should have the following standard installations:

```bash
sudo apt install nginx nodejs postgresql npm
```

## Additional Configuration

Remember to configure your PostgreSQL database and any other OS-level configurations specific to your RFID project.

For detailed instructions on setting up Python and the timer, as well as additional configurations, refer to the respective sections in this guide.
